/*
  The following class creates and stores approximate M-filters for
  topology optimization.  These filters can be constructed via
  different strategies that ensure that the matrices satisfy the
  positivity and sum-to-unity properties.

  Mass-matrix approach:

  Given a matrix M with non-negative entries, and a scalar r >= 0, a
  filter matrix F can be formed as follows. First construct a diagonal
  matrix D such that

  D_{i} = sum_{j} M_{ij}

  The filter matrix F, can be formed implicitly as

  F = (D + r^2*D^{-2/d}*(D - M))^{-1}*D

  or

  F = (1 + r^2*D^{-2/d-1}*(D - M))^{-1}

  Note that the filter matrix satisfies the property that F*e = e, where
  e is a vector of all unit entries.

  Introducing the definitions:

  Ainv = (1 + r^2*D^{-2/d})^{-1}

  and

  B = r^2*D^{-2/d-1}*Ainv

  Then the approximate action of the filter matrix can be written using a
  Neumann series as

  F ~ T^{T} * \sum_{n=0}^{N} (B*M)^{n} A^{-1}

  Where T is defined as

  T = \sum_{n=0}^{N} (B*M)^{n} A^{-1} e
